This system is an extended version of the ping pong example code that comes along with Lightbend's minimal seed template for an Akka with Scala build i.e., [**activator-akka-scala-seed**](https://www.lightbend.com/activator/templates).

Wherein the ping pong actors are instead implemented as *Finte State Machines* and share same class definition. You can find comprehensive design details @ [Thinking in Actors the Ping Pong way!](http://geek.shivamkapoor.com/)

The purpose though is to explore actor systems in their simplest form.
